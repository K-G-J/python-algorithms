"""
The sieve provides a set of steps for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.

The sieve works by first assuming that all numbers from {2,â€¦,n} are prime, and then successively marking them as NOT prime.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Create a list of all integers from 2 to n.
    - since using indices to represent the actual number, we will start the array from 0 and essentially ignore the values of array[0] and array[1].
2. Start with the smallest number in the list (2, the smallest prime number).
3. Mark all multiples of that number up to n as not prime.
4. Move to the next non-marked number and repeat this process until the entire list has been covered.

When the steps are complete, all remaining non-marked numbers are prime.
